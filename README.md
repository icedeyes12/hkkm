##🎯 How to Play

Nothing much you can do here yet—this build is only for testing and preview purposes 🤔.

You can:

Create an account or play as a guest

Navigate the menus (Job Center, Casino, Yard, Fishing, My Room, Shop, Daily, Leaderboard)

Trigger stub actions that show what features will look like

Try the hidden cheat codes (titit / 𓂸) to open the test center


Full gameplay (farming, fishing, jobs, casino games, etc.) is still under development 🛠️.
